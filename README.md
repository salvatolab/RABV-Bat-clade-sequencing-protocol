# RABV-Bat-clade-sequencing-protocol

321_sequences_Troupin_2016.fasta - Dataset with 321 genome sequences spanning diversity of RABV. This dataset was obtained from Troupin C, Dacheux L, Tanguy M, Sabeta C, Blanc H, Bouchier C, et al. (2016) Large-Scale Phylogenomic Analysis Reveals the Complex Evolutionary History of Rabies Virus in Multiple Carnivore Hosts. PLoS Pathog 12(12): e1006041. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1006041.

sanger_N_sequences.fasta - seventy-four RABV partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences from Southern Brazil.

320WGS_N_gene.fasta - Aligment file with 321_sequences_Troupin_2016.fasta sequences (we removed a duplicated sequence) and sanger_N_sequences.fasta sequences.

320WGS_N_gene.fasta.treefile - A phylogenetic tree reconstructed from the alignment of the 320 representative sequences from Troupin et al. 2016 and our generated N sequences.

WGS_generated_sequences.fasta - A fasta file including the 25 sequences generated by our developed sequencing protocol.

N_sequences.fasta - A fasta file including the sanger N sequences from the same 25 genomes sequenced by our developed protocol, properly renamed based on the "rename_N_sequences" file.

Bat_Troupin_2016.fasta - A fasta file with 61 Bat clades genomes extracted from the dataset provided by Troupin et al. 2016.
